  #there are 2 python notebooks containing some of the code for the data analysis, data engineering, building the model...

#kaggle-2:  
  #there are 2 python notebooks containing some of the code for the data analysis, data engineering, building the model...  
  #these notebooks were made on the ICR - Identifying Age-Related Conditions competition - posted on kaggle - dataset  
  #this was one of my submission using a neural network into a xgboost model. It was a recreative attempt so it's by no means a top level model.
